	abstract = {Requirement for high accuracy and speed of grasping operation for motion planning is very important. Motion planning algorithms for avoiding obstacles in narrow channels play a vital role for robotic arm effectively operating grasp tasks. The potential function-based RRT*-connect (P-RRT*-connect) algorithm for motion planning is presented by combining the bidirectional artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld into the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) in order to enhance the performance of the RRT*. The motion path is found out by exploring two path trees from the start node and destination node, respectively, with the rapidly exploring random tree star. Two trees advance each other at the same time according to the attractive potential ﬁeld and the repulsion potential ﬁeld generated by the artiﬁcial potential ﬁeld method of sampled nodes until they meet. The P-RRT*-connect algorithm is especially suitable for solving the problem of narrow channels. The simulation results prove that the P-RRT*-connect algorithm is more efﬁcient than potential Function-based RRT* (P-RRT*) regardless of the number of iterations or the running time. The experimental data show that the time for the P-RRT*-connect to ﬁnd the optimal path from the starting node to the target node is half than that of the P-RRT*, and the number of iterations of the P-RRT*-connect is also about one-third less than that of the P-RRT* which is useful for real time.},

	abstract = {We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for minimizing the execution time of a coordinated parallel motion plan for a relatively dense swarm of homogeneous robots in the absence of obstacles. In our first model, each robot has a specified start and destination on the square grid, and in each round of coordinated parallel motion, every robot can move to any adjacent position that is either empty or simultaneously being vacated by another robot. In this model, our algorithm achieves constant stretch factor : if every robot starts at distance at most d from its destination, then the total duration of the overall schedule is O(d), which is optimal up to constant factors. Our result holds for distinguished robots (each robot has a specific destination), identical (unlabeled) robots, and most generally, classes of different robot types (where each destination specifies a required type of robot). We also show that finding the optimal coordinated parallel motion plan is NP-hard, justifying approximation algorithms. In our second model, each robot is a unit-radius disk in the plane, and robots can translate continuously in parallel subject to not intersecting, i.e., having disk centers at L2-distance at least 2. We prove the same result---constant-factor approximation algorithm to minimizing executio{\textbackslash}snurd  time via constant stretch factor---when the pairwise L{\textbackslash}infty -distance between disk centers is at least 2 2 = 2.8284 . . . . On the other hand, for N densely packed disks at distance at most 2 + {\textbackslash}delta  for a sufficiently small {\textbackslash}delta  {\textgreater} 0, we prove that a stretch factor of {\textbackslash}Omega (N 1/4) is sometimes necessary (when densely packed), while a stretch factor of {\textbackslash}scrO (N 1/2) is always possible.},

	abstract = {In the recent decade, many research efforts in robotic society have considered motion planning for maintaining connectivity in networked robotic system (NRS) by exploiting robotic autonomous mobility. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) in the communication society aims at fully exploiting the spectrum in a wireless network, while the motion planning is seldom considered, as a wireless device itself may not decide where to go. In this article, joint communication–motion planning (JCMP) is proposed to boost the capability of NRS by exploiting both the adaptive communications and mobility control of autonomous robots. Speciﬁcally, we propose a JCMP framework for NRS, which aims at jointly exploiting the degree-of-freedom in mobility, space, time, frequency and power dimensions from both the motion and communication components. Afterward, we design and evaluate JCMP in a conventional and a CR-relay-assisted robot system, which shows the capability of JCMP in improving the performance of NRS. Finally, we summarize the proposed JCMP-enabled NRS framework and provide a series of future research directions.},

	abstract = {Computational resources of quantum computing can enhance robotic motion, decision making, and path planning. While the quantum paradigm is being applied to individual robots, its approach to swarms of simple and interacting robots remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between swarm robotics and quantum computing, in the framework of a search and rescue mission. We focus on a decision-making and path-planning collective task. Thus, we present a quantum-based path-planning algorithm for a swarm of robots. Quantization enters position and reward information (measured as a robot’s proximity to the target) and path-planning decisions. Pairwise information-exchange is modeled through a logic gate, implemented with a quantum circuit. Path planning draws upon Grover’s search algorithm, implemented with another quantum circuit. Our case study involves a search and rescue scenario, inspired by ant-foraging behavior in nature, as an example of swarm intelligence. We show that our method outperforms two ant-behavior simulations, in NetLogo and Java, respectively, presenting a faster convergence to the target, represented here by the source of food. This study can shed light on future applications of quantum computing to swarm robotics.},
