  abstract = {Computational resources of quantum computing can enhance robotic motion, decision making, and path planning. While the quantum paradigm is being applied to individual robots, its approach to swarms of simple and interacting robots remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between swarm robotics and quantum computing, in the framework of a search and rescue mission. We focus on a decision-making and path-planning collective task. Thus, we present a quantum-based path-planning algorithm for a swarm of robots. Quantization enters position and reward information (measured as a robot's proximity to the target) and path-planning decisions. Pairwise information-exchange is modeled through a logic gate, implemented with a quantum circuit. Path planning draws upon Grover's search algorithm, implemented with another quantum circuit. Our case study involves a search and rescue scenario, inspired by ant-foraging behavior in nature, as an example of swarm intelligence. We show that our method outperforms two ant-behavior simulations, in NetLogo and Java, respectively, presenting a faster convergence to the target, represented here by the source of food. This study can shed light on future applications of quantum computing to swarm robotics.},

This year's problem is to coordinate the motion of multiple robots in order to reach their targets without collisions and minimizing the makespan. It is a classical multi-agent path finding problem with the specificity that the instances are highly dense in an unbounded grid. Using the heuristics outlined in this article, our team won first place with the best solution to 202 out of 203 instances and optimal solutions to at least 105 of them. The main ingredients include several different strategies to compute initial solutions coupled with a heuristic called Conflict Optimizer to reduce the makespan of existing solutions.},

  abstract = {We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for minimizing the execution time of a coordinated parallel motion plan for a relatively dense swarm of homogeneous robots in the absence of obstacles. In our first model, each robot has a specified start and destination on the square grid, and in each round of coordinated parallel motion, every robot can move to any adjacent position that is either empty or simultaneously being vacated by another robot. In this model, our algorithm achieves constant stretch factor : if every robot starts at distance at most d from its destination, then the total duration of the overall schedule is O(d), which is optimal up to constant factors. Our result holds for distinguished robots (each robot has a specific destination), identical (unlabeled) robots, and most generally, classes of different robot types (where each destination specifies a required type of robot). We also show that finding the optimal coordinated parallel motion plan is NP-hard, justifying approximation algorithms. In our second model, each robot is a unit-radius disk in the plane, and robots can translate continuously in parallel subject to not intersecting, i.e., having disk centers at L2-distance at least 2. We prove the same result---constant-factor approximation algorithm to minimizing executio\textbackslash snurd  time via constant stretch factor---when the pairwise L\textbackslash infty -distance between disk centers is at least 2 2 = 2.8284 . . . . On the other hand, for N densely packed disks at distance at most 2 + \textbackslash delta  for a sufficiently small \textbackslash delta  {$>$} 0, we prove that a stretch factor of \textbackslash Omega (N 1/4) is sometimes necessary (when densely packed), while a stretch factor of \textbackslash scrO (N 1/2) is always possible.},

  abstract = {The motion planning problem for multiple objects is studied where an object is a 2-dimensional region whose sides are line segments parallel to the axes of R and translations are the only motions allowed. Towards this end we analyze the structure of configuration space, the space of points that correspond to positions of the objects. In particular, we consider CONNECTED, the set of all points in configuration space that correspond to configurations of the objects where the objects form one connected component. We show that CONNECTED consists of faces of various dimensions such that if there is a path in CONNECTED between two 0-dimensional faces (vertices) of CONNECTED then there is a path between them along 1-dimensional faces (edges) of CONNECTED. It is known that if there is a motion between two configurations of CONNECTED then there is a path in CONNECTED between the configurations. Thus the existence of a motion between two vertices of CONNECTED implies a motion corresponding to a path along edges of CONNECTED. Hence the motion planning problem is reduced from a search of a high dimensional space to a graph searching problem.},

Our pathfinding algorithm, discrete-RRT (dRRT), is an adaptation of the celebrated RRT algorithm for the discrete case of a graph, and it enables a rapid exploration of the high-dimensional configuration space by carefully walking through an implicit representation of the tensor product of roadmaps for the individual robots. We demonstrate our approach experimentally on scenarios that involve as many as 60 degrees of freedom and on scenarios that require tight coordination between robots. On most of these scenarios our algorithm is faster by a factor of at least 10 when compared to existing algorithms that we are aware of.},

  abstract = {Requirement for high accuracy and speed of grasping operation for motion planning is very important. Motion planning algorithms for avoiding obstacles in narrow channels play a vital role for robotic arm effectively operating grasp tasks. The potential function-based RRT*-connect (P-RRT*-connect) algorithm for motion planning is presented by combining the bidirectional artificial potential field into the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) in order to enhance the performance of the RRT*. The motion path is found out by exploring two path trees from the start node and destination node, respectively, with the rapidly exploring random tree star. Two trees advance each other at the same time according to the attractive potential field and the repulsion potential field generated by the artificial potential field method of sampled nodes until they meet. The P-RRT*-connect algorithm is especially suitable for solving the problem of narrow channels. The simulation results prove that the P-RRT*-connect algorithm is more efficient than potential Function-based RRT* (P-RRT*) regardless of the number of iterations or the running time. The experimental data show that the time for the P-RRT*-connect to find the optimal path from the starting node to the target node is half than that of the P-RRT*, and the number of iterations of the P-RRT*-connect is also about one-third less than that of the P-RRT* which is useful for real time.},

  abstract = {The third computational geometry challenge was on a coordinated path planning problem in which a collection of square robots need to move on the integer grid, from their given starting points to their target points, and without collision between robots, or between robots and a set of input obstacles. We designed and implemented three algorithms for this problem. First, we computed a feasible solution by placing middle-points outside of the minimum bounding box of the starting positions, the target positions and the obstacles, and moving each robot from its starting point to its target point through a middle-point. Second, we applied a simple local search approach where we repeatedly delete and insert again a random robot through an optimal path. It improves the quality of the solution, as the robots no longer need to go through the middle-points. Finally, we used simulated annealing to further improve this feasible solution. We used two different types of moves: We either tightened the whole trajectory of a robot, or we stretched it between two points by making the robot move through a third intermediate point generated at random.},

In this article, joint communication\textendash motion planning (JCMP) is proposed to boost the capability of NRS by exploiting both the adaptive communications and mobility control of autonomous robots. Specifically, we propose a JCMP framework for NRS, which aims at jointly exploiting the degree-of-freedom in mobility, space, time, frequency and power dimensions from both the motion and communication components. Afterward, we design and evaluate JCMP in a conventional and a CR-relay-assisted robot system, which shows the capability of JCMP in improving the performance of NRS. Finally, we summarize the proposed JCMP-enabled NRS framework and provide a series of future research directions.},
