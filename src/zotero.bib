  abstract = {We propose a new approach to robot path planning that consists of building and searching a graph connecting the local minima of a potential function defined over the robot's configuration space. A planner based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is considerably faster than previous path planners and solves problems for robots with many more degrees offreedom (DOFs). The power of the planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local minima of this function. The most powerful of these techniques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local minima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed representations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the planner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces). Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this article.},

While the quantum paradigm is being applied to individual robots, its approach to swarms of simple and interacting robots remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between swarm robotics and quantum computing, in the framework of a search and rescue mission. We focus on a decision-making and path-planning collective task. Thus, we present a quantum-based path-planning algorithm for a swarm of robots. Quantization enters position and reward information (measured as a robot's proximity to the target) and path-planning decisions. Pairwise information-exchange is modeled through a logic gate, implemented with a quantum circuit. Path planning draws upon Grover's search algorithm, implemented with another quantum circuit. Our case study involves a search and rescue scenario, inspired by ant-foraging behavior in nature, as an example of swarm intelligence. We show that our method outperforms two ant-behavior simulations, in NetLogo and Java, respectively, presenting a faster convergence to the target, represented here by the source of food. This study can shed light on future applications of quantum computing to swarm robotics.},

  abstract = {We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for minimizing the execution time of a coordinated parallel motion plan for a relatively dense swarm of homogeneous robots in the absence of obstacles. In our first model, each robot has a specified start and destination on the square grid, and in each round of coordinated parallel motion, every robot can move to any adjacent position that is either empty or simultaneously being vacated by another robot. In this model, our algorithm achieves constant stretch factor : if every robot starts at distance at most d from its destination, then the total duration of the overall schedule is O(d), which is optimal up to constant factors. Our result holds for distinguished robots (each robot has a specific destination), identical (unlabeled) robots, and most generally, classes of different robot types (where each destination specifies a required type of robot). We also show that finding the optimal coordinated parallel motion plan is NP-hard, justifying approximation algorithms. In our second model, each robot is a unit-radius disk in the plane, and robots can translate continuously in parallel subject to not intersecting, i.e., having disk centers at L2-distance at least 2. We prove the same result---constant-factor approximation algorithm to minimizing executio\textbackslash snurd  time via constant stretch factor---when the pairwise L\textbackslash infty -distance between disk centers is at least 2 2 = 2.8284 . . . . On the other hand, for N densely packed disks at distance at most 2 + \textbackslash delta  for a sufficiently small \textbackslash delta  {$>$} 0, we prove that a stretch factor of \textbackslash Omega (N 1/4) is sometimes necessary (when densely packed), while a stretch factor of \textbackslash scrO (N 1/2) is always possible.},

Towards this end we analyze the structure of configuration space, the space of points that correspond to positions of the objects. In particular, we consider CONNECTED, the set of all points in configuration space that correspond to configurations of the objects where the objects form one connected component. We show that CONNECTED consists of faces of various dimensions such that if there is a path in CONNECTED between two 0-dimensional faces (vertices) of CONNECTED then there is a path between them along 1-dimensional faces (edges) of CONNECTED. It is known that if there is a motion between two configurations of CONNECTED then there is a path in CONNECTED between the configurations. Thus the existence of a motion between two vertices of CONNECTED implies a motion corresponding to a path along edges of CONNECTED. Hence the motion planning problem is reduced from a search of a high dimensional space to a graph searching problem.},

  abstract = {Many exciting robotic applications require multiple robots with many degrees of freedom, such as manipulators, to coordinate their motion in a shared workspace. Discovering high-quality paths in such scenarios can be achieved, in principle, by exploring the composite space of all robots. Sampling-based planners do so by building a roadmap or a tree data structure in the corresponding configuration space and can achieve asymptotic optimality. The hardness of motion planning, however, renders the explicit construction of such structures in the composite space of multiple robots impractical. This work proposes a scalable solution for such coupled multi-robot problems, which provides desirable path-quality guarantees and is also computationally efficient. In particular, the proposed \textbackslash drrtstar\textbackslash{} is an informed, asymptotically-optimal extension of a prior sampling-based multi-robot motion planner, \textbackslash drrt. The prior approach introduced the idea of building roadmaps for each robot and implicitly searching the tensor product of these structures in the composite space. This work identifies the conditions for convergence to optimal paths in multi-robot problems, which the prior method was not achieving. Building on this analysis, \textbackslash drrt\textbackslash{} is first properly adapted so as to achieve the theoretical guarantees and then further extended so as to make use of effective heuristics when searching the composite space of all robots. The case where the various robots share some degrees of freedom is also studied. Evaluation in simulation indicates that the new algorithm, \textbackslash drrtstar\textbackslash, converges to high-quality paths quickly and scales to a higher number of robots where various alternatives fail. This work also demonstrates the planner's capability to solve problems involving multiple real-world robotic arms.},

Every robot is no longer required to move to a specific target, but rather to some target placement that is assigned to its group. We call this problem k-color multi-robot motion planning and provide a sampling-based algorithm specifically designed for solving it. At the heart of the algorithm is a novel technique where the k-color problem is reduced to several discrete multi-robot motion planning problems. These reductions amplify basic samples into massive collections of free placements and paths for the robots. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by an implementation for the case of disc robots and polygonal robots translating in the plane. We show that the algorithm successfully and efficiently copes with a variety of challenging scenarios, involving many robots, while a simplified version of this algorithm, that can be viewed as an extension of a prevalent sampling-based algorithm for the k-color case, fails even on simple scenarios. Interestingly, our algorithm outperforms a well established implementation of PRM for the standard multi-robot problem, in which each robot has a distinct color.},

Motion planning algorithms for avoiding obstacles in narrow channels play a vital role for robotic arm effectively operating grasp tasks. The potential function-based RRT*-connect (P-RRT*-connect) algorithm for motion planning is presented by combining the bidirectional artificial potential field into the rapidly exploring random tree star (RRT*) in order to enhance the performance of the RRT*. The motion path is found out by exploring two path trees from the start node and destination node, respectively, with the rapidly exploring random tree star. Two trees advance each other at the same time according to the attractive potential field and the repulsion potential field generated by the artificial potential field method of sampled nodes until they meet. The P-RRT*-connect algorithm is especially suitable for solving the problem of narrow channels. The simulation results prove that the P-RRT*-connect algorithm is more efficient than potential Function-based RRT* (P-RRT*) regardless of the number of iterations or the running time. The experimental data show that the time for the P-RRT*-connect to find the optimal path from the starting node to the target node is half than that of the P-RRT*, and the number of iterations of the P-RRT*-connect is also about one-third less than that of the P-RRT* which is useful for real time.},

  abstract = {The third computational geometry challenge was on a coordinated path planning problem in which a collection of square robots need to move on the integer grid, from their given starting points to their target points, and without collision between robots, or between robots and a set of input obstacles. We designed and implemented three algorithms for this problem. First, we computed a feasible solution by placing middle-points outside of the minimum bounding box of the starting positions, the target positions and the obstacles, and moving each robot from its starting point to its target point through a middle-point. Second, we applied a simple local search approach where we repeatedly delete and insert again a random robot through an optimal path. It improves the quality of the solution, as the robots no longer need to go through the middle-points. Finally, we used simulated annealing to further improve this feasible solution. We used two different types of moves: We either tightened the whole trajectory of a robot, or we stretched it between two points by making the robot move through a third intermediate point generated at random.},

  abstract = {We propose a distributed and optimal motion planning algorithm for multiple robots. The computationally expensive problem is decomposed into two modules - path planning and velocity planning. The D' search method is applied in both modules, based on either geometric formulation or schedule formulation. Optimization is achieved at the individual robot level by defining cost functions t o minimize, and also at the team level by a global measurement function reflecting performance indices of interest as a team. Contrary to our knowledge of previous results on multirobot motion planning that either obtain optimal solutions through centralized and exhaustive computing, or achieve distributed implementations without considering any optimization issues, our approach combines these two features and explicitly optimizes performance functions through a distributed implementation. It is also one of the few that is capable of handling outdoor rough terrain environments and real time replanning. Simulations are shown on a Mars-like rough terrain using a 3D vehicle planner and control simulator. The algorithm was also implemented and successfully run on a group of Nomad 200 indoor robots.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of optimal multi-robot path planning on graphs (MPP) over four distinct minimization objectives: the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), the total distance, and the maximum (single-robot traveled) distance. On the structure side, we show that each pair of these four objectives induces a Pareto front and cannot always be optimized simultaneously. Then, through reductions from 3SAT, we further establish that computation over each objective is an NP-hard task, providing evidence that solving MPP optimally is generally intractable. Nevertheless, in a related paper Yu and LaValle (2015), we design complete algorithms and efficient heuristics for optimizing all four objectives, capable of solving MPP optimally or near-optimally for hundreds of robots in challenging setups.},

  abstract = {In the recent decade, many research efforts in robotic society have considered motion planning for maintaining connectivity in networked robotic system (NRS) by exploiting robotic autonomous mobility. On the other hand, cognitive radio (CR) in the communication society aims at fully exploiting the spectrum in a wireless network, while the motion planning is seldom considered, as a wireless device itself may not decide where to go. In this article, joint communication\textendash motion planning (JCMP) is proposed to boost the capability of NRS by exploiting both the adaptive communications and mobility control of autonomous robots. Specifically, we propose a JCMP framework for NRS, which aims at jointly exploiting the degree-of-freedom in mobility, space, time, frequency and power dimensions from both the motion and communication components. Afterward, we design and evaluate JCMP in a conventional and a CR-relay-assisted robot system, which shows the capability of JCMP in improving the performance of NRS. Finally, we summarize the proposed JCMP-enabled NRS framework and provide a series of future research directions.},
